This is a Cyberpunk 2077 mod that helps measure in-game distance in meters, with five decimals. The tracking point is attached to the player, so it works on every movement.
In addition to that, it also shows:

- An estimated current speed, based on the last 50 frames (25 samples)
- Player's position in the workd (x, y, z)
- Elapsed time (since the mod was started), with seconds and millisecond decimals

Compatibility: Both 1.63 and 2.x versions of the game, provided you have working CET.
