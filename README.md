This is a Cyberpunk 2077 mod that helps measure in-game distance in meters.
Compatibility: Both 1.63 and 2.x versions of the game.

This mod is intended for use as a distance meter (or, if you are driving: an odometer). It displays this main measurement as meters, with five decimals.

Besides that, it includes two approximations of V's current speed:
- (immediate) Speed between the two last segments measured, which is based in V's position and millisecond time between 3 rendered frames
- (trailing) Same as the above, but for 16 frames.

Top speed for each of the above-said derived speeds. The speed measurements may be subject to refining.

And:
- V's position in the world (x, y, z)
- Elapsed time (since the mod was started), with seconds and millisecond decimals
